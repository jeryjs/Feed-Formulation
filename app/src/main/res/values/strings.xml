    <string name="about_text_block_1">This mobile application has been developed by a team of scientist at ICAR-National Institute of Animal Nutrition and Physiology (NIANP), Bengaluru.\nThis application is useful for the farmer to prepare balanced total mixed ration for a cow or buffalo on least cost basis with available feed ingredients.\nNutrient requirements are calculated on the basis of ICAR (2013) requirements and examples are given based on the practical field condition.\nIt is encouraged to use more number of locally available ingredients for deriving best combination of least cost feed formulation.</string>
    <string name="about_text_block_2">Disclaimer: The calculated ration formation is based on the input given by the user not by the developer.\nThe ration formulated by this app is only guideline and it cannot be claimed for any commercial or legal purpose.\nThe loss or any misguidance of the application cannot be claimed from the developer.\nIt is a guideline of ration formulation.\nIt may be verified by the Animal Nutritionist before feeding to the animals.\n© ICAR-NIANP, Bengaluru, 2021</string>
